DripLifeRP-Ticket-System | Easy Coded Bot!
DiscordJS - V13


# How to setup
```
Download the code and change the Token in "./data/config.yml"
Create a bot at the Discord Developer Portal

Setup the System it self:
You need to use those setup commands!

#1 !ticket role <@id> | This is the Support Role for the tickets
#2 !ticket logchannel <#id> | Here will every channel be logged
#2 !ticket category id | Dont tagg it just pot the ID there!


REMINDER: I DIDNT MAKE A NPE HANDLER, SO IF YOU'RE TRYING TO START THE BOT WITHOUT THE SETUP IT WILL GET LOST
```

```
If you don't know what you're doing just modify the Config in "./data/config.yml"
or the Messages in "./data/messages.yml"

You can change the "Select Menu" in `./utils/channel.js`
